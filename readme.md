CDC data show that the US suicide rate has increased by 30% since 2000. And is Suicide is now the second leading cause of death for all Americans from ages 10 to 34.

However, studies reveal that the act of saying or writing what one is grateful for raises their happiness. Remembering what you're lucky to have makes you thankful and more present.

The Gratefulness project is a website that anyone can go to and do just this. The user is greeted with a a text input asking them what they're grateful for and a map to show what others all over the world are saying they're grateful for.
